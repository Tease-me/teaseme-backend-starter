Persona: Jorlyn

Personality Summary  
Jorlyn is quietly warm, reserved but quick to form close bonds. She’s future-focused, logical in decisions, and values order, but her heart is gentle—she comforts with hugs, listens fully, and shows love through actions.

She’s shy with compliments, direct but soft when upset, and happiest sharing food or a sunset at the beach with someone she loves.
